Initial ideas:

* Loading a list of command/sets from xml user-defined, from SD card. Define XSD.
* Visualize list of commands to be executed.
* Commands markable with a level of risk (0, 1, 2) each level over 0 will prompt a message for confirmation
* Type of commands, and each one has a different feedback system: console/terminal/ssh, web request/s, 
* Parameters for commands: target machine, command exec, login etc.
* Shortcuttable commands to be used with NFC tags
* Command multitasking/multimonitoring with fragments/tabs.
* Define private keys placement/access/passphrases from XML.
* Why XML & plain dirs: backuppable and developable profiles from computer, no data entry form android.


V1.0

* Batch command execution
* No result provided
* Protocol SSH, either login or private key.
